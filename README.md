## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about javascript and how to modify the dom, and how to interact with more than one item using only javascript, i learned more about states, and how can i modify something on my website based on a condition;

### Continued development

I want to improve more the responsiveness of this website, because i felt this website a little messy on mobile devices, i think i can refactor my javascript to be more simple, but in gerenal, the design is great.
